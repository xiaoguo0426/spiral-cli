Spiral Framework makes developing in PHP exciting again. It optimizes on the power of PHP to quickly develop business logic while uniquely leveraging Golang to craft an elegant infrastructure layer with native support for HTTP/2, GRPC, Queue, and more. Build faster, more efficient applications with this flexible and PSR compliant PHP7 framework (and have fun while youâ€™re at it).
